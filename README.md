# console_Astar_project
simple A Star algorthim 
This project uses a ordinary Algorithm to avoid random generating obstacles and finding the best possible way to the intended goal on the 10*10 grid.
How It Works

Grid Generation: A 10x10 grid is created with random obstacles (|).

A Algorithm Execution*:

Calculates g (movement cost) and h (heuristic distance to the goal)

Expands the lowest f = g + h node until it reaches the goal

Solution Output: The path is marked with * and displayed in the console.
Example Output
Initial Grid:
.b........
..|.......
....|.....
..||......
....X.....

Solution:
*b........
.**.......
...*|.....
..||*.....
....X.....
